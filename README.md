# CreditPolicy-MO Environment for MO-Gymnasium

The **CreditPolicy-MO** environment simulates a periodic credit-lending process in which an
agent adjusts lending policy parameters (approval thresholds and exposure caps) to balance
multiple institutional objectives:
- Profitability
- Portfolio risk
- Financial inclusion
- Fairness
- Policy stability and complexity

The environment will be compatible with the MO-Gymnasium API for multi-objective reinforcement learning. Each episode represents a sequence of monthly decisions (period-level
granularity).
